# Recursion
- These two ruby files are the solutions for the Odin Project: recursion

## fibonacci.rb
- takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence.
- method #fibs uses iteration for the solution
- method #fibs_rec uses recursion for the solution

## merge_sort.rb
- a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets.
- method #merge_sort  sorts a given array using a "merge sort" method.
