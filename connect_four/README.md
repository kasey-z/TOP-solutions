# Connect Four

- This is the solution for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-ruby)

- The purpose of the project is to do it in TDD-style, using RSpec.

- It's a basic commander line game where each of two player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Player wins if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

- You need to install Ruby in order to run this game. Run it by typing $ruby lib/script.rb in the root dir.
